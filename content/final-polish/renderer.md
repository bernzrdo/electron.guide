# The Final Polish before release

**The BrowserWindow is actually a _chromium_ web browser!**


### **Passing data into BrowserWindow**

If you use [React.js](https://reactjs.org/) for your BrowserWindow javascript, you may need to pass data from the `main` process to the `renderer` process just in time for your initial state and props.

You need to know the difference between these two events: `dom-ready` and `ready-to-show`.

1. `ready-to-show` event is part of `BrowserWindow`, and `dom-ready` event is part of `webContents`.
2. In the BrowserWindow event life-cycle, **`dom-ready`** always comes **BEFORE** **`ready-to-show`**.
3. You can inject data like this:

```javascript
// main.js (main process)

const { BrowserWindow } = require('electron')

let win = new BrowserWindow({ show: false })

win.once('ready-to-show', () => {
    win.show()
})

win.webContents.on('dom-ready', (event) => {
    win.webContents.send("<channel>", Data1, Data2, Data3) // This is asynchronous
})
``` 
```javascript
// renderer.js (renderer process)

const { ipcRenderer } = require('electron')

ipcRenderer.once("<channel>", (event, args) => {
  let Data1 = args[0]
})
```

See:

* https://electronjs.org/docs/api/browser-window
* https://electronjs.org/docs/api/web-contents

### **Fade in BrowserWindow**

The above advice will _abrupty_ show the BrowserWindow without any flickering. If you are using [React.js](https://reactjs.org/), then it is possible that your page has not yet completed rendering. If you want to guarantee that your page has finished rendering, then only `show` it after rendering is complete.

You can further smoothen your application by creating a **fade-in** effect to make it feel less _abrupt_.

A **linear** **fade-in** animation curve can be easily accomplished. **`totalTime (ms)`** controls how long the fade-in effect should take in total (transparent â†’ opaque). **`totalSteps`** controls the time-resolution.


```javascript
// main.js (main process)

const { BrowserWindow, ipcMain} = require('electron')

let win = new BrowserWindow({ show: false, opacity: 0.0 }) // initially transparent

win.webContents.on('dom-ready', (event) => {
    win.webContents.send("<channel>", Data1) // This is asynchronous
})

ipcMain.once("browser-window-ready-to-show", (event, args) => {
  win.show()
})
``` 
```javascript
// renderer.js (renderer process)

const { ipcRenderer, remote } = require('electron')

ipcRenderer.once("<channel>", (event, args) => {
  let Data1 = args[0]

  ipcRenderer.send("browser-window-ready-to-show")

  let currentWindow = remote.getCurrentWindow()

  let totalSteps = 20.0
  let totalTime = 1000.0

  let currentOpacity = currentWindow.getOpacity()

  let timerID = setInterval(() => {
    currentOpacity = currentOpacity + (1.0/totalSteps)
    currentWindow.setOpacity(currentOpacity)
    if currentOpacity > 1.0 {
      clearInterval(timerID);
    }
  }, totalTime/totalSteps)
})
```

If your BrowserWindow is set to transparent, you can also use a CSS based solution for fading-in.

### **Prevent BrowserWindow refreshes**

A user can press `Cmd+R` (on macOS) or `Ctrl+R/Ctrl+Shift+R/F5` (on Windows) to refresh the webpage shown by the BrowserWindow. True native applications don't exhibit this behaviour.

The recommended solution is to replace the default menu to disable this behaviour. On Windows, you can call `win.removeMenu()`. On macOS, you can call `Menu.setApplicationMenu(Menu.buildFromTemplate([]))`. You should only do it for production since you will lose access to DevTools.

For Kiosk Mode, another solution is to Disable the keyboard shortcuts when the BrowserWindow takes focus and then unregister the shortcuts when the BrowserWindow loses focus **or** is closed/hidden.

```javascript
const electronLocalshortcut = require('electron-localshortcut')

win.on('focus', (event) => {
    electronLocalshortcut.register(win, ['CommandOrControl+R','F5'], () => {})
})

win.on('blur', (event) => {
    electronLocalshortcut.unregisterAll(win)
})
```

See: https://electronjs.org/docs/api/global-shortcut

### **Prevent File Drags into BrowserWindow**

A user can drag a file into a BrowserWindow. The BrowserWindow will then display the file.
You can disable it by using https://github.com/ecrmnn/electron-disable-file-drop.

```js
require('electron-disable-file-drop'); // In renderer process
```


### **Disable Dragging and User Selections**

Users can drag certain elements inside the Body. They can also "select" content on the window (to cut/copy). True native applications don't exhibit this behavior.

Add this CSS:

```css
.noselect {
  user-select: none;
}
```

Add this attribute and class to the Body and various HTML elements:

```html
<body draggable="false" class="noselect">
```

### **Hide DevTools**

The user can easily open up the BrowserWindow DevTools and peek inside and modify your variables. This is very dangerous from a security perspective.

The user can open the DevTools by keyboard shortcuts and passing command line arguments.

Remember to disable it for Production release:

```js
const { BrowserWindow } = require('electron')

let win = new BrowserWindow({ webPreferences: {devTools: false} })

```

See: https://github.com/electron/electron/blob/master/docs/api/browser-window.md#new-browserwindowoptions

You may have to take other measures too to hide DevTools successfully.
